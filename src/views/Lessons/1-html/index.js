					There is a lot of debate on whether or not html is a programming language because by
					itself it canâ€™t do any logic. It is just a way to tell the other programs what a thing is.
					For example let's say you want a friend to know that your text that you are about to send
					is sarcastic, how would you let them know?
				</Typography>
			</Block>

			<Block name="Example of an element" classes={classes}>
				<Typography>
					Well if your friend was a computer you would probibly text them:
					<Typography variant="body2">
						{"<sarcastic>"}You're so cool{"</sarcastic>"}
					</Typography>
					With that (very mean) text you computer friend knows whe you start being sarcastic and
					when you stop.

					So as you can see your computer friend would have no problem reading this but let me help
					you out a bit.

					I would like each of you to go to your favorate website and find something in the code
